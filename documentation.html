          <p>Our app provides a small tutorial and an intro screen for beginners. Because of the interesting technology of object detection, this app would fascinate most beginners and it has a lot of cases of use, as shopping is almost a day to day thing nowadays. Intermediate people can start improving their experience with apps by taking advantage of the friends graphs system. Using that, they will be able to create a profile, add friends, create a group and see and share products that he or his friends like. The app doesn't provide anything in addition for expert users, but it could be improved by adding gesture-based interaction for those users.</p>

          <h6>Interaction design patterns in our project</h6>
            <p>Design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems. We tried to include as many interactional design patterns in our prototypes, the most notable ones being:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Design patterns to not overcomplicate the screens, like <b>Extras on demand</b> on our main screen with recommendations;</li>
                <li>Design patterns to help the navigation of a beginner user on our app; The most notable ones are <b>wayfinding</b>, <b>signposts</b>, <b>
                  Global navigation</b>, <b>Hub and spoke</b>, etc; Our app also respects the 3-click-rule as all of the functionalities that a user can want from our app can be found within 3 clicks/taps;</li>
                <li>Design patterns useful for online shopping, like the <b>Prominent “done” button</b> and a <b>Command history</b> of past transactions;</li>
                <li>The app is structured according to the <b>Diagonal balance</b> pattern and it provides a <b>Progress indicator</b> and <b>Cancelability</b> for time-consuming operations, in our case the object mapping our app does;</li>
              </ul>

          <h6>Interation design patterns regarding social interactions in our project</h6>
          <p>Our application also offers functionalities of social interaction that are modeled after the next social design patterns:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Our application can help a user find what he wants very fast, delivering a <b>Satisficing</b> experience to the user, but also provides a <b>Safe exploration</b> experience;</li>
            <li>For the products our users want to buy it provides them time to think their choices providing posibilities for <b>Changes in midstream</b> and <b>Deferred choices</b> having the posibility to postpone their transactions by leaving the products in his personal cart. The user can also leave reviews, choose favorites and see past transactions being a part of the <b>Prospective memory</b> pattern;</li>
            <li>The users can also see the reviews of other users being able to take <b>Other people's advice</b>;</li>
            <li>Our app contains a friends graph system, containing a lot of social UX design patterns like <b>Sign-up and registration</b>, <b>Empty States</b>, <b>User profile</b>, <b>Collaboration(share pay)</b>, etc;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When it comes to <b>affective factors</b> and <b>emotions</b>, our application can bring satisfaction to our users through it's ease of use and usability. It contains a social graph for the user to be able to communicate and share what he likes in our application with his friends, bringing in feelings of friendliness and affection. For a beginner, it can bring amusement and excitement, which will disappear over time. Intermediate users will be more calm and relaxed when using the app. The application can also easily bring out negative and forceful emotions such as anger and annoyance, as the photo system is hard to implement in real life. The photo may not be clear enough for the algorithm, or it may choose the wrong object, or a lot of the time it won't be able to find the improved recommendation, making the user bored and disappointed by the app. To avoid those cases, the algorithm for object recognition has to be very good and the words used when talking to the user about an error, and maybe suggesting how he can solve it, have to be chosen carefully.</p>
