                    <p>Alex is a savvy individual who holds a bachelor's degree in economics and is passionate about making informed purchasing decisions. </p>
                    <p>When he was younger, he had a terrible accident in which he lost a huge sum of money in a business venture, making him more cautious on how he spends and invests his money. He is not stingy with his money, but utilitarian, only buying things that are strictly necessary.</p>
                    <p>Alex also loves spoiling his wife and himself. Recognizing the importance of thorough research, he checks product reviews to ensure the items he chooses meet their expectations. When considering a specific product, Alex goes the extra mile by exploring alternative options available in the market. To further enhance his decision-making process, Alex consults his trusted network of friends for their recommendations for their firsthand experiences and insights.</p>

                    <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
                    <p>Alexandru Lupu is a dedicated and enthusiastic 22 years old is bachelor's student at the
                        Faculty of Computer Science in Iasi. With a strong passion for technology and a relentless drive
                        for excellence, he stands out as an exceptional individual among his peers. Alexandru's thirst
                        for knowledge, but also his easy-going personality and sense of humor make him to standout out.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of Alexandru's greatest strengths is his ability to work collaboratively in a team. He is an
                        excellent team player, always willing to share his expertise and support his peers. He actively
                        engages in group projects, demonstrating strong communication and leadership skills. Alexandru's
                        dedication to teamwork allows him to effectively contribute to the success of any collaborative
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>Beyond his academic pursuits, Alexandru is involved in extracurricular activities that showcase
                        his passion for computer science. He is an active member of the university's computer science
                        club, where he participates in programming competitions and organizes workshops to help fellow
                        students, but also future students to enhance their coding abilities. His commitment to the club
                        demonstrates his desire to give back to the community and foster a collaborative learning
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>Despite his academic achievements and extracurricular involvements, Alexandru maintains a
                        well-rounded lifestyle. He understands the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance
                        and engages in various recreational activities. In his free time, he enjoys playing chess,
                        reading books, meeting with his friends, and exploring new programming projects, being
                        interested especially in the design area.</p>
                    <p>He likes to be very energetic and productive, to make the most of his day. He is also a very
                        practical person, which doesn't like to overcomplicate things, he considers it useless and a
                        waste of time. He is also a technology geek, being very interested in the domain and always
                        wanting to know what is new, how things are evolving, and how technology can help people in their
                        day-to-day lives and not only. Also, he is a very practical person, thinks everything multiple
                        times before doing it, to make sure that he makes the best decision possible, so there will not
                        be any repercussions. For instance, when he wants to buy anything, he usually searches on
                        multiple sources to be sure that he makes the best deal at the moment, especially because he is
                        far from home, his natal city being Deva, and he has to make the most of the money his parents
                        send.</p>

            <div class="personaScenarios">
                <h5>Scenarios</h5>
                <p>Alex has to make a project that is due in less than a week for the DSFUM subject. For the project, he
                    has to work in a team with 2 other friends and they have to use an Arduino. The problem is that they
                    don't have the equipment bought yet, because they can't synchronize their schedules in order to meet
                    and decide together what to buy. Using our application he will be able to see the best offers in
                    terms of money and performance and he and his teammates will be able to share a cart where they can
                    each share and add products, in the end having the option to split the payment.</p>
